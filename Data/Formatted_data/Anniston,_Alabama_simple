Anniston is a city in Calhoun County in the state of Alabama .
As of the 2000 census , the population of the city is 24,276 .
According to the 2005 U.S. Census estimates , the city had a population of 23,741 .
The city is the county seat of Calhoun County and one of two urban centers\/principal cities of and included in the Anniston-Oxford Metropolitan Statistical Area .
Named The Model City by Atlanta newspaperman Henry W. Grady for its careful planning in the late 19th century , the city is situated on the slope of Blue Mountain .
Though the surrounding area was settled long before , the mineral resources in the area of Anniston were n't exploited until the Civil War .
During that time , the Confederate States of America established and operated an iron furnace near present day downtown Anniston , until the furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1865 .
Later , clay pipe for sewer systems became the focus of Anniston 's industrial output .
Clay pipe , also called soil pipe , was popular until the advent of plastic pipe in the 1960s .
In 1865 , at the end of the Civil War , Union troops near the furnace wrongfully hanged one of the few residents .
Charley Lloyd , a farmer working the land in what is now Anniston west of Noble Street , was executed by Union General John Croxton for allegedly shooting a Union cavalryman .
In fact , the Union trooper had been killed by a Confederate soldier who was fighting the continuing destruction of local facilities .
Croxton 's only evidence against Lloyd was that the shooting took place near Lloyd 's farm .
In 1872 , the Woodstock Iron Company , organized by Samuel Noble and Union Gen. Daniel Tyler , rebuilt the furnace on a much larger scale , as well as started a planned community named Woodstock but later renamed `` Anniston '' for Annie Scott Tyler , wife of railroad president Alfred L. Tyler .
Anniston was chartered as a town in 1873 .
Though the roots of the town 's economy were in iron , steel and pipe clay , planners touted it as a health resort , and several hotels began operating .
Schools also appeared , including The Noble Institute , a school for girls established in 1886 , and The Alabama Presbyterian College for Men , founded in 1905 .
Careful planning and easy access to rail transportation helped make Anniston the fifth largest city in the state from 1890 's to 1950 's .
In 1917 , at the start of World War I , the United States Army established a training camp at Fort McClellan .
On the other side of town , the Anniston Army Depot opened during World War II as a major weapons storage and maintenance site , a role it continues to serve as munitions-incineration progresses .
Most of the site of Fort McClellan was incorporated into Anniston in the late 1990s , and The Army closed the fort in 1999 following the Base Realignment and Closure round of 1995 .
Anniston was the center of national controversy in 1961 when a mob bombed a bus filled with civilian Freedom Riders during the American civil rights movement .
The Freedom Riders were riding an integrated bus to protest Alabama 's Jim Crow segregation laws that denied African Americans their civil rights .
One of the buses was fire-bombed outside of Anniston on Mother 's Day , Sunday , May 14 , 1961 .
As the bus burned , the mob held the doors shut , intent on burning the riders to death .
An exploding fuel tank caused the mob to retreat , allowing the riders to escape the bus .
The Riders were viciously beaten as they tried to flee , and only warning shots fired into the air by highway patrolmen prevented the riders from being lynched on the spot .
Located along Alabama Highway 202 W about five miles ( 8 km ) west of downtown , the site today is home to a historic marker .
In response to the violence , the city formed a bi-racial Human Relations Council ( HRC ) made up of prominent white business and religious leaders , but when they attempted to integrate the `` whites-only '' public library on Sunday afternoon , September 15 , 1963 ( the same day as the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham ) , further violence ensued and two black ministers , N.Q. Reynolds and Bob McClain , were severely beaten by a mob .
The HRC chairman , white Presbyterian minister Rev. Phil Noble , worked with an elder of his church , Anniston City Commissioner Miller Sproull , to avoid KKK mob domination of the city .
In a telephone conference with President John F. Kennedy , the President informed the HRC that after the Birmingham church bombing he had stationed additional Federal Troops at Fort McClellan .
On September 16 , 1963 , with city police present , Noble and Sproull escorted Black ministers into the library .
In February 1964 , Anniston Hardware , owned by the Sproull family , was bombed , presumably in retaliation for Commissioner Sproull 's integration efforts .
On the night July 15 , 1965 a white racist rally was held in Anniston , after which Willie Brewster , a black foundry worker , was shot and killed while driving home from work .
A $ 20,000 reward was raised by Anniston civic leaders , and resulted in the apprehension , trial and conviction of the accused killer , Damon Strange , who worked for a leader of the Ku Klux Klan .
Historian Taylor Branch called the conviction of Damon Strange a `` breakthrough verdict '' on p. 391 of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book , At Canaan 's Edge .
Strange was convicted by an all-white Calhoun County jury to the surprise of many people , including civil rights leaders who had planned to protest an acquittal .
This was the first conviction of a white person for killing a black person in civil rights era Alabama .
