Basketball has been a Summer Olympics sport for men consistently since 1936 .
Prior to its inclusion as a medal sport , it was held as demonstration event in 1904 .
Women 's basketball was played in the Olympics only since 1976 .
The United States is by far the most successful nation in Olympic basketball .
American men 's teams won 13 of 16 tournaments they participated in , including seven successive titles from 1936 to 1968 .
American women 's teams won 6 titles out of 8 participations , including four in a row from 1996 to 2008 .
Basketball was invented by the Canadian James Naismith in Springfield , Massachusetts , in 1891 .
Within a few decades , the new game became popular throughout the United States as an indoor sport .
The popularity spread overseas and the International Basketball Federation ( FIBA ) was organized in 1932 in Geneva , Switzerland .
Thanks in part to the effort of Phog Allen ( Kansas Jayhawks collegiate coach ) , the first Olympic basketball tournament was organized in the 1936 Summer Olympics at Berlin on outdoor tennis courts .
Dr. Naismith presented the medals to the top three teams .
According to the Olympic rules of that time , all of the competitors were amateurs .
The tournament was held indoors for the first time in 1948 .
The American team proved its dominance , winning the first seven Olympic tournaments until 1968 without losing a single game .
The Soviet Union , that joined the Olympics in 1952 , became the Americans ' main rival , and was runner-up four successive times from 1952 to 1964 .
Yugoslavia emerged as a major force in 1968 , when they beat the Soviets in the semifinal but lost to the Americans in the final .
The United States winning streak ended in 1972 , when the Soviet Union beat them in the gold-medal game in highly controversial circumstances .
The Americans refused to receive their silver medals and they have been kept in IOC possession ever since .
The Americans reclaimed the gold medal in 1976 , with Yugoslavia runner-up for the second time .
In 1980 , with the Americans ' absence due to the boycott , Yugoslavia became the third team to win the title after beating the Soviets in the semifinals and Italy in the final .
The United States regained the title in 1984 , beating Spain in the final , with the Soviets boycotting this time .
The Soviets won the gold medal for the second time in 1988 , after beating the Americans for the second time in the semifinal , and the Yugoslavs in the gold medal game .
In 1989 , through the leadership of President Borislav StankoviÄ‡ , FIBA approved the rule that allowed NBA players to compete in international tournaments , including the Olympics .
In the next Olympics in 1992 , the `` Dream Team '' won the gold medal with average winning margin of 44 points , and without calling a time out .
By this time , Soviet Union and Yugoslavia no longer existed , but their successors continued to be among the leading forces .
Two newly-independent counties , Croatia and Lithuania , won the silver and bronze medals respectively .
The Americans repeated their victory in 1996 and 2000 , but they were not as impressive as in 1992 .
In 1996 , Atlanta was the only host city so far with an NBA team since NBA players were allowed to compete in the Olympics , as Atlanta is home to the Hawks .
Serbia and Montenegro was the runner-up in Atlanta , and France in Sydney , with Lithuania winning bronze again on both occasions .
The renewed dominance of the United States was interrupted in 2004 when the Americans suffered their third defeat in Olympic history to Argentina in the semifinals .
The Argentines went on to beat Italy in the final and become the fourth team to win the Olympic title .
The United States regained the gold medal in 2008 , with Spain as runner-up , and won their first global title since the 2000 Olympics .
