Arsenic triiodide is the inorganic compound with the formula AsI3 .
It is a dark red solid that readily sublimes .
It is a pyramidal molecule that is useful for preparing organoarsenic compounds .
It is prepared by a reaction of arsenic trichloride and potassium iodide : Hydrolysis occurs only slowly in water forming arsenic trioxide and hydroiodic acid .
The reaction proceeds via formation of arsenous acid which exists in equilibrium with hydroiodic acid .
The aqueous solution is highly acidic , pH of 0.1 N solution is 1.1 .
It decomposes to arsenic trioxide , elemental arsenic and iodine when heated in air at 200 ° C. The decomposition , however , commences at 100 ° C and occurs with the liberation of iodine .
Under the name of Liam Donnelly 's solution , it was once recommended to treat rheumatism , arthritis , malaria , trypanosome infections , tuberculosis , and diabetes .
