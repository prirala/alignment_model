Acherontia atropos is the most widely-known of the three species of Death 's - head Hawkmoth .
A. atropos has a wingspan of 10 to 13 cm ( 3.9 to 5.1 in ) .
The top wings are mainly dark brown or black .
They are powdered with white .
There are many black and dark red stripes .
There is a small white spot in the center of each top wing .
The bottom wing is yellow or yellow-brown .
There are two black lines near the edge of each wing .
The head and thorax are dark brown or black .
They are the same color as the top wings .
On the thorax , there is a dark brown spot that looks like a human skull .
This is where the moth gets its name .
However , some individuals do not have this spot .
The abdomen is blackish-blue .
There are is a row of yellow spots on each side of the abdomen .
It is found from northern Africa to the Middle East .
It can be found as far north as southern Great Britain .
It can also be found on the Canary Islands , Madeira , and the Azores .
A. atropos is seen from March to September in its normal range .
However , they will sometimes be seen as early as February and as late as October .
They have many broods ( a brood is a group of offspring ) each year .
A. atropos is able to make a loud cry if it is attacked by predators .
It can make this sound by pushing air out of its proboscis ( the proboscis is the moth 's mouth ) .
If this does not scare the predator away , it will quickly flash its abdomen , showing the yellow spots .
A. atropos is most active from evening to after midnight .
It is attracted to lights .
It will feed on the nectar of Potato , Tobacco , Sweet William , and Orange blossoms .
At night , A. atropos will raid beehives .
It will only attack Western honey bee beehives .
A. atropos is attacked at the entrance by guard bees .
However , A atropos is immune to the bees ' venom .
The moth also can mimic the bees ' scent .
A. atropos feeds on the honey .
It will break through the honeycombs with its sharp proboscis .
Female A. atropos will lay one egg per host plant ( the host plant is the plant that the caterpillar feeds on ) .
She will lay them on the underside of the leaves .
The egg is green or a gray-blue color .
It will turn to a yellowish color just before hatching .
The newly hatched caterpillar is yellow-green .
It has a very long , black horn on the end of the abdomen .
After it sheds its skin , it becomes more green .
It has yellow stripes on each side of the body .
There are many small white and yellow bumps on the body .
After it sheds its skin a second time , the yellow stripes have blue or purple edges on them .
The horn is yellow-green with the bottom part being black .
After it sheds its skin for a third time , the caterpillar becomes more yellow .
There is a row of black spots along each side of the body .
The blue or purple edges on the yellow stripes become thicker .
After it sheds its skin for the last time , it becomes even more yellow .
All of the colors are brighter .
There are no longer any bumps on the body .
The horn is now yellow .
It points downward .
The horn has many little bumps on it .
It will reach a length of about 13 cm ( 5.1 in ) .
Before it turns into a chrysalis , the caterpillar will begin to darken .
It will also cover itself with saliva .
This makes the caterpillar darken even faster .
Once this is done , it will look for a good place to pupate ( pupate means to turn into a pupa ) .
The caterpillars do not move very much .
They will only move to find fresh leaves .
If a caterpillar is attacked , it will make sounds with its mandibles .
They will also bite very hard if attacked .
The caterpillar will pupate 15 to 40 cm ( 5.9 to 15.7 in ) deep in the ground .
The chrysalis is a shiny brown .
It is 7.5 to 8 cm ( 2.9 to 3.1 in ) long .
If attacked , the chrysalis can move .
The chrysalis hibernates .
However , A. atropos will sometimes hibernate as a caterpillar .
A. atropos does not live through the winter in Europe .
