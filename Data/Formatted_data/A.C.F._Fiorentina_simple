ACF Fiorentina , commonly referred to as simply Fiorentina , is a professional Italian football club from Florence , Tuscany .
Founded by a merger in 1926 ( refounded in 2002 ) , Fiorentina have played at the top level of Italian football for the majority of their existence ; only four clubs have played in more Serie A seasons .
Fiorentina have won two Italian Championships , in 1955-56 and again in 1968-69 , as well as winning six Coppa Italia trophies and one Italian Super Cup .
On the European stage , Fiorentina won the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup in 1960-61 and lost the final one year later .
They finished runners-up in the 1956-57 European Cup , losing against Real Madrid , and also came close to winning the UEFA Cup , finishing as runners-up in the 1989-90 season .
Since 1931 , the club have played at the Stadio Artemio Franchi , which currently has a capacity of 47,282 .
The stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations .
Fiorentina are known widely by the nickname Viola , a reference to their distinctive purple colors .
Associazione Calcio Fiorentina was founded in the autumn of 1926 by local noble and National Fascist Party member Luigi Ridolfi , who initiated the merger of two older Florentine clubs , CS Firenze and PG Libertas .
The aim of the merger was to give Florence a strong club to rival those of the more dominant Italian Football Championship sides of the time from Northwest Italy .
Also influential was the cultural revival and rediscovery of Calcio Fiorentino , an ancestor of modern football that was played by members of the Medici family .
After a rough start and three seasons in lower leagues , Fiorentina reached the Serie A in 1931 .
That same year saw the opening of the new stadium , originally named Giovanni Berta , after a prominent fascist , but now known as Stadio Artemio Franchi .
At the time , the stadium was a masterpiece of engineering , and its inauguration was monumental .
In order to be able to compete with the best teams in Italy , Fiorentina strengthened their team with some new players , notably the Uruguayan Pedro Petrone , nicknamed el Artillero .
Despite enjoying a good season and finishing in fourth place , Fiorentina were relegated the following year , although they would return quickly to Serie A. In 1941 they won their first Coppa Italia , but the team were unable to build on their success during the 1940s because of World War II and other troubles .
In 1950 Fiorentina started to achieve consistent top-five finishes in the domestic league .
The team consisted of great players such as well-known goalkeeper Giuliano Sarti , Sergio Cervato , Francesco Rosella , Guido Gratton , Giuseppe Chiappella and Aldo Scaramucci , but above all the attacking duo of Brazilian Julinho and Argentinian Miguel Montuori .
This team won Fiorentina 's first scudetto ( Italian championship ) in 1955-56 , 12 points ahead of second-place Milan .
Milan beat Fiorentina to top spot the following year , but more significantly Fiorentina became the first Italian team to play in a European Cup final , when a disputed penalty led to a 2-0 defeat at the hands of by Alfredo di Stéfano 's Real Madrid .
Fiorentina were runners-up again in the three subsequent seasons .
In the 1960-61 season the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe , winning the first Cup Winners ' Cup against Rangers .
After several years of runner-up finishes , Fiorentina dropped away slightly in the 1960s , bouncing from 4th to 6th place , although the club won the Coppa Italia and the Mitropa Cup in 1966 .
While the 1960s did result in some trophies and good Serie A finishes for Fiorentina , nobody believed that the club could challenge for the title .
The 1968-69 season started with Milan as frontrunners , but on match day 7 they lost to Bologna and were overtaken by Gigi Riva 's Cagliari .
Fiorentina , after an unimpressive start , then moved to the top of the Serie A , but the first half of their season finished with a 2-2 draw against Varese , leaving Cagliari as outright league leader .
The second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams , Milan , Cagliari and Fiorentina .
Milan fell away , instead focusing their efforts on the European Cup , and it seemed that Cagliari would retain top spot , but after losing against Juventus , Fiorentina took over at the top .
The team then won all of their remaining matches , beating rivals Juve in Turin on the penultimate matchday to seal their second , and last , national title .
In the European Cup competition the following year , Fiorentina had some good results , including a win in the Soviet Union against Dynamo Kyiv , but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals after a 3-0 defeat in Glasgow to Celtic .
Viola players began the 1970s decade with Scudetto sewed on their breast , but the period was not especially fruitful for the team .
After a fifth place finish in 1971 , they finished in mid-table almost every year , even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978 .
The Viola did win the Anglo-Italian League Cup in 1974 and won the Coppa Italia again in 1975 .
The team consisted of young talents like Vincenzo Guerini and Moreno Roggi , who had the misfortune to suffer bad injuries , and above all Giancarlo Antognoni , who would later become an idol to Fiorentina 's fans .
The young average age of the players led to the team being called Fiorentina Ye-Ye .
In 1980 , Fiorentina was bought by Flavio Pontello , from a rich house-builder family .
He quickly changed the team 's anthem and logo , leading to some complaints by the fans , but he started to bring in high-quality players such as Francesco Graziani and Eraldo Pecci from Torino , Daniel Bertoni from Sevilla , Daniele Massaro from Monza and a young Pietro Vierchowod from Sampdoria .
The team was built around Giancarlo Antognoni , and in 1982 , Fiorentina were involved in an exciting duel with rivals Juventus .
After a bad injury to Antognoni , the league title was decided on the final day of the season , when Fiorentina were denied a goal against Cagliari and were unable to win .
Juventus won the title with a disputed penalty , and the rivalry between the two teams erupted .
The following years were strange for Fiorentina , who vacillated between high finishes and relegation battles .
Fiorentina also bought two interesting players , El Puntero Ramón Díaz and , most significantly , the young Roberto Baggio .
In 1990 , Fiorentina fought to avoid relegation right up until the final day of the season , but did reach the UEFA Cup final , where they again faced Juventus .
The Turin team won the trophy , but Fiorentina 's tifosi once again had real cause for complaint : the second leg of the final was played in Avellino ( Fiorentina 's home ground was suspended ) , a city with a lot of Juventus ' fans , and emerging star Roberto Baggio was sold to the rival team on the day of the final .
Pontello , suffering from economic difficulties , was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in Florence 's streets .
The club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker Mario Cecchi Gori .
The first season under Cecchi Gori 's ownership was one of stabilization , after which the new chairman started to sign some good players like Brian Laudrup , Stefan Effenberg , Francesco Baiano and , most importantly , Gabriel Batistuta , who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s .
In 1993 , however , Cecchi Gori died and was succeeded as chairman by his son , Vittorio .
Despite a good start to the season , Cecchi Gori fired the coach , Luigi Radice , after a defeat against Atalanta , and replaced him with Aldo Agroppi .
The results were dreadful : Fiorentina fell into the bottom half of the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season .
Claudio Ranieri was brought in as coach for the 1993-94 season , and that year , Fiorentina dominated Serie B ( second division ) .
Upon their return to Serie A , Ranieri put together a good team centred around new top scorer Batistuta , signing the young talent Rui Costa from Benfica and the new world champion Brazilian defender Márcio Santos .
The former became an idol to Fiorentina fans , while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season .
The Viola finished the season in 10th .
The following season , Cecchi Gori bought other important players like Stefan Schwarz .
The club again proved its mettle in cup competitions , winning the Coppa Italia against Atalanta and finished joint third in Serie A. In the summer , Fiorentina was the first non-national champion to win the Supercoppa Italiana , defeating Milan 2-1 at the San Siro .
Fiorentina 's 1995-96 season was disappointing in the league , but they did reach the Cup Winners ' Cup semi-final by beating Gloria Bistrita , Sparta Prague , and Benfica .
The team lost the semi-final to the eventual winner of the competition , Barcelona ( Away 1-1 , Home 0-2 ) .
The season 's main signings were Luís Oliveira and Andrei Kanchelskis , the latter of whom suffered a lot of injuries .
At the end of the season , Ranieri left Fiorentina for Valencia , and Cecchi Gori appointed Alberto Malesani .
Fiorentina played well but struggled against smaller teams , although they did manage to qualify for the UEFA Cup .
Malesani left Fiorentina after only a season and was succeeded by Giovanni Trapattoni .
With Trapattoni 's expert guidance and Batistuta 's goals , Fiorentina challenged for the title in 1998-99 but finished the season in third , earning them qualification for the Champions League .
The following year was disappointing in Serie A , but Viola played some historical matches in Champions League , beating Arsenal 1-0 at the old Wembley Stadium and Manchester United 2-0 in Florence .
They were ultimately eliminated in the second group stage .
At the end of the season , Trapattoni left the club and was replaced by Turkish coach Fatih Terim .
More significantly , however , Batistuta was sold to Roma , who eventually won the title the following year .
Fiorentina played well in 2000-01 and stayed in the top half of Serie A , despite the resignation of Terim and the arrival of Roberto Mancini .
They also won the Coppa Italia for the sixth and last time .
The year 2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina , as the terrible state of the club 's finances was revealed : they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around USD 50 million .
The club 's owner , Vittorio Cecchi Gori , was able to raise some more money , but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club .
Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the 2001-02 season and went into judicially controlled administration in June 2002 .
This form of bankruptcy ( sports companies can not exactly fail in this way in Italy , but they can suffer a similar procedure ) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the 2002-03 season , and as a result effectively ceased to exist .
The club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Florentia Viola with shoe and leather entrepreneur Diego Della Valle as new owner , and was admitted into Serie C2 , the fourth tier of Italian football .
The only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was Angelo Di Livio , whose commitment to club 's cause further endeared him to the fans .
Helped by Di Livio and 30-goal striker Christian Riganò , the club won its Serie C2 group with considerable ease , which would normally have led to a promotion to Serie C1 .
However , due to the bizarre Caso Catania ( Catania Case ) the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into Serie B , something that was only made possible by the Italian Football Federation 's decision to resolve the Catania situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24 and promoting Fiorentina for `` sports merits . ''
In the 2003 off-season , the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design , and re-incorporated itself as ACF Fiorentina .
The club 's unusual double promotion was controversial , with some suggesting that Fiorentina did not deserve it .
The club , however , remained in Serie B and managed to finish the 2003-04 season in sixth place .
This put the Viola in a two-legged playoff against Perugia ( the 15th-place finisher in Serie A ) for a top-flight place during the next season .
Fiorentina completed their remarkable comeback by winning the match 2-1 on aggregate , with both goals scored by Enrico Fantini , to gain promotion back to Serie A. In their first season back in Italian football 's top flight , the club struggled to avoid relegation , only securing survival on the last day of the season and only avoiding a relegation playoff based on their head-to-head record against Bologna and Parma .
In 2005 , Della Valle decided to appoint Pantaleo Corvino as new sports director .
In 2005-06 , Fiorentina hired Cesare Prandelli as their new head coach and made several signings during the summer transfer market , most notably Palermo 's 20-goal striker Luca Toni and French goalkeeper Sébastien Frey .
The combination of captain Dario Dainelli and Czech international regular Tomáš Ujfaluši in defense , Cristian Brocchi as midfield ball winner , Martin Jorgensen on the wing , Stefano Fiore as playmaker and key marksman Toni , with Frey in goal , proved to be an outstanding force in Serie A , giving them a fourth place finish with 74 points and qualifying the team for the third qualifying round of the Champions League .
Toni scored 31 goals in 38 appearances , the first player to pass the 30-goal mark since Antonio Valentin Angelillo in the 1958-59 season , for which he was awarded the European Golden Boot .
On 14 July 2006 , however , Fiorentina were relegated to Serie B due to their involvement in the 2006 Serie A match fixing scandal and given a 12-point penalty .
The team was reinstated to the Serie A on appeal , but with a 19-point penalty for the 2006-07 season .
The team 's UEFA Champions League place was also rescinded .
After the start of the season , Fiorentina 's penalization was reduced from 19 points to 15 on appeal to the Italian courts .
Despite starting the 2006-07 season with a 15-point penalty , Fiorentina nevertheless managed to secure a place in the 2007-08 edition of the UEFA Cup .
The combination of Toni and Adrian Mutu proved to be one of Serie A 's most proficient strike partnerships , scoring 31 goals between them .
While many doubted the potential of the Viola in the 2007-08 season due to Toni 's departure , Fiorentina had a sensational start to the season and were tipped by Marcello Lippi and other prominent names in football as a surprise challenger for the Scudetto .
This form tailed off towards the middle of the season , however , with several disappointing losses in connection with a grievous family loss suffered by club manager Prandelli .
The club reached the semi-final of the UEFA Cup , where they were ultimately defeated by Rangers on penalties after two 0-0 ties .
The season ended on a high note as Fiorentina defeated Torino 1-0 on the final day of the season to secure a Champions League spot at the expense of Milan .
That campaign ended in the group stages , however , with the club finishing third and securing a path to the UEFA Cup instead .
The 2008-09 season continued this success , a fourth place finish assuring Fiorentina 's spot in 2010 's Champions League playoffs .
The Viola also took part to the 2008-09 UEFA Champions League , reaching the group phase after defeating Slavia Prague in the third qualifying round , but the club did not manage to qualify to the knockout rounds and was successively eliminated from the 2008-09 UEFA Cup by Ajax .
In contrast to their Champions League campaign , La Viola remained in the top tier of the domestic league .
A reversal of trends took place in the ongoing 2009-10 season , as the club saw a dip in their Serie A form , yet proved itself to be a surprise dark horse in Europe .
Fiorentina started their domestic campaign strongly , trailing leaders Internazionale along with Juventus and Sampdoria earlier in the season , but steadily lost momentum and slipped to mid-table positions at the latter half of the season .
In Europe , the team got past Sporting Clube de Portugal in the qualifying rounds and drawn a tight group consisting of Olympique Lyonnais , Liverpool and Debrecen .
Losing their first away fixture against Lyon , many dismissed their chances of getting through , but the Italians staged a comeback with winning all their remaining matches , which included defeating Liverpool home and away .
The Viola qualified as group champions , but eventually succumbed to Bayern Munich due to away goals , in a controversial double encounter involving what was considered as poor refereeing .
Tom Henning Øvrebø , who led the first leg in Germany , was then lambasted by journalists and Italian footballing figures for his decisions , most notably allowing a Miroslav Klose offside goal ( that eventually fired Bayern through the next round ) , calling into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football .
Fiorentina also maintained a strong Coppa Italia campaign , reaching the semi-final before being defeated by the eventual winner Internazionale .
The domestic season ended on a sour note as the Viola failed to reach a European position .
During this period , on 24 September 2009 , Andrea Della Valle resigned from his position as chairman of Fiorentina , and announced all duties would be temporarily transferred to Mario Cognini , Fiorentina 's vice president until a permanent position could be filled .
On 26 October 2009 , Andrea Della Valle stepped down as chairman .
The position is now vacant .
In June 2010 , the Viola bid farewell to long-time manager Prandelli ( by then the longest-serving coach in the team 's history ) , who was departing to coach the Italian national team , with Catania 's young Siniša Mihajlović replacing him .
In 2012 , Mihajlović left to become the manager of Serbia .
He was replaced with Vincenzo Montella .
As of 16 January 2012 .
