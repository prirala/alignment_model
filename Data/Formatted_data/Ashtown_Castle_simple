Ashtown Castle is a fortified house in the Phoenix Park in Dublin .
It was found hidden within the walls of a much larger and more recent building that was being used by the Papal Nuncio until 1978 .
At that time , the more recent and larger building was deemed structurally irreparable due to dry rot .
But as that was being demolished , Ashtown castle was discovered .
It has now been restored and forms part of the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre .
It is thought to originally date from the 1430s , as it is built to dimensions that conform with a government policy of the time who offered # 10 to those who built a castle for their own safety .
The castle was later incorporated into the construction of Ashtown Lodge which was to serve as the official residence of the Under Secretary from 1782 .
The grounds in which Ashtown Castle is located has held a number of concerts in the past few years .
