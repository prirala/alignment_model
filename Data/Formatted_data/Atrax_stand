Spiders of the genus Atrax have very strong venom .
They aggressively defend their territory and chase off attackers who may scare them by making a threat display .
Next they will bite .
The fastest death occurred in 1927 when a young boy died within fifteen minutes of being bitten .
Thirteen deaths were recorded in the fifty years before antivenom was invented for this spider 's bite .
In English they are sometimes called Sydney Funnel Web spiders because they come from around that part of Australia .
