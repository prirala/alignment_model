A major ( or the key of A ) is a major scale based on A , with the pitches A , B , C ♯ , D , E , F ♯ , and G ♯ .
Its key signature has three sharps .
Its relative minor is F-sharp minor and its parallel minor is A minor .
The key of A major is the only key where a Neapolitan sixth chord on requires both a flat and a natural accidental .
In the treble , alto , and bass clefs , the G ♯ in the key signature is placed higher than C ♯ .
However , in the tenor clef , it would require a ledger line and so G ♯ is placed lower than C ♯ .
Although not as rare in the symphonic literature as sharper keys , examples of symphonies in A major are not as numerous as for D major or G major .
Beethoven 's Symphony No. 7 , Bruckner 's Symphony No. 6 and Mendelssohn 's Symphony No. 4 comprise a nearly complete list of symphonies in this key in the Romantic era .
Mozart 's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet are both in A major , and generally Mozart was more likely to use clarinets in A major than in any other key besides E-flat major .
A major occurs frequently in chamber music .
Franz Schubert 's Piano Quintet known as the Trout Quintet and Antonín Dvořák 's Piano Quintet No. 2 are both in A major .
Johannes Brahms , César Franck , and Gabriel Fauré wrote violin sonatas in A major .
In connection to Beethoven 's Kreutzer Sonata , Peter Cropper said that A major `` is the fullest sounding key for the violin . ''
According to Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart , A major is a key suitable for `` declarations of innocent love , ... hope of seeing one 's beloved again when parting ; youthful cheerfulness and trust in God . ''
For orchestral works in A major , the timpani are typically set to A and E a fifth apart , rather than a fourth apart as for most other keys .
Hector Berlioz complained about the custom of his day in which timpani tuned to A and E a fifth apart were notated C and G a fourth apart , a custom which survived as late as the music of Franz Berwald .
