Aspens are a type of poplar tree with leaves that move with the slightest wind .
The two main species are both called ` trembling aspens ' or ` quaking aspens ' on account of their leaves .
Populus tremuloides is the American aspen .
It is common in temperate and colder regions of North America .
It forms large stands ( groups ) of genetically identical trees ( clones ) connected by a single underground root system .
These trees form through root sprouts coming off an original parent tree .
The largest known fully connected aspen is a grove in Utah nicknamed ` Pando ' , and some experts call it the largest organism in the world , by mass or volume .
It covers 0.43 km2 ( 106 acres ) and is estimated to weigh 6,600 short tons ( 6,000 t ) .
Populus tremula is a species of poplar native to cool temperate regions of Europe and Asia , from the British Isles east to Kamchatka , north to inside the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and northern Russia , and south to central Spain , Turkey , the Tian Shan mountain system , North Korea , and northern Japan .
It also occurs at one site in northwest Africa in Algeria .
In the south of its range , it occurs at high altitudes in mountains .
It is a hardy species which tolerates long , cold winters and short summers .
Aspen is dioecious , so individual trees are either male or female ( in contrast to most trees , where male and female flowers occur on the same tree ) .
Trees flower in March and April , before the leaves appear , with both the male and female trees producing catkins .
Pollinated female catkins ripen in early summer and release tiny seeds which are tufted with hairs .
Like other aspens , its main method of reproduction is vegetative ( asexual ) .
It spreads extensively by root sprouts , which may be produced up to 40 metres from the parent tree .
They form extensive clonal colonies .
Large numbers of new shoots can be produced in this way , especially after a major disturbance such as fire .
