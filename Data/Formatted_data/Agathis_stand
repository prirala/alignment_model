Agathis is a genus of evergreen , coniferous trees , the kauri .
They grow mainly in the southern hemisphere , including southeast Asia , areas of the western Pacific , and Australasia .
Agathis is a relatively small genus , with only 21 known species .
As a conifer , it produces pine cones .
Mature Agathis can become quite large , reaching 130 feet ( about 40 m ) in height and 10 feet ( about 3 m ) in diameter .
The genus is part of the ancient Araucariaceae family of conifers , a group once widespread during the Jurassic period , but now largely restricted to the southern hemisphere .
Mature kauri trees have large trunks , forming a bole with little or no branching below the crown .
In contrast , young trees are normally conical in shape , forming a more rounded or irregularly shaped crown as they mature .
In the logging industry it is generally referred to as commercial grade mahogany .
Timber from the Agathis has several uses , including cabinet making , boat building , musical instruments , and in years past , artificial limbs .
It also produces a wide variety of resins .
