Advanced Audio Coding ( AAC ) is a standardized , lossy compression and encoding scheme for digital audio .
Designed to be the successor of the MP3 format , AAC generally achieves better sound quality than MP3 at similar bit rates .
AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC , as part of the MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 specifications .
Part of the AAC known as High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding ( HE-AAC ) which is part of MPEG-4 Audio is also adopted into digital radio standards like DAB + and Digital Radio Mondiale , as well as mobile television standards DVB-H and ATSC-M\/H .
AAC supports inclusion of 48 full-bandwidth ( up to 96 kHz ) audio channels in one stream plus 16 low frequency effects ( LFE , limited to 120 Hz ) channels , up to 16 `` coupling '' or dialog channels , and up to 16 data streams .
The quality for stereo is satisfactory to modest requirements at 96 kbit\/s in joint stereo mode ; however , hi-fi transparency demands data rates of at least 128 kbit\/s ( VBR ) .
The MPEG-2 audio tests showed that AAC meets the requirements referred to as `` transparent '' for the ITU at 128 kbit\/s for stereo , and 320 kbit\/s for 5.1 audio .
AAC is also the default or standard audio format for YouTube , iPhone , iPod , iPad , Nintendo DSi , iTunes , DivX Plus Web Player and PlayStation 3 .
It is supported on PlayStation Portable , Wii ( with the Photo Channel 1.1 update installed ) , Sony Walkman MP3 series and later , Sony Ericsson ; Nokia , Android , BlackBerry , and webOS-based mobile phones , with the use of a converter .
AAC has also seen some adoption on in-dash car audio especially on high-end units such as the Pioneer AVIC series .
AAC was developed with the cooperation and contributions of companies including AT&T Bell Laboratories , Fraunhofer IIS , Dolby Laboratories , Sony Corporation and Nokia .
It was officially declared an international standard by the Moving Picture Experts Group in April 1997 .
It is specified both as Part 7 of the MPEG-2 standard , and Subpart 4 in Part 3 of the MPEG-4 standard .
In 1997 , AAC was first introduced as MPEG-2 Part 7 , formally known as ISO\/IEC 13818-7 :1997 .
This part of MPEG-2 was a new part , since MPEG-2 already included MPEG-2 Part 3 , formally known as ISO\/IEC 13818-3 : MPEG-2 BC ( Backwards Compatible ) .
Therefore , MPEG-2 Part 7 is also known as MPEG-2 NBC ( Non-Backward Compatible ) , because it is not compatible with the MPEG-1 audio formats ( MP1 , MP2 and MP3 ) .
MPEG-2 Part 7 defined three profiles : Low-Complexity profile ( AAC-LC \/ LC-AAC ) , Main profile ( AAC Main ) and Scalable Sampling Rate profile ( AAC-SSR ) .
AAC-LC profile consists of a base format very much like AT&T 's Perceptual Audio Coding ( PAC ) coding format , with the addition of temporal noise shaping ( TNS ) , the Dolby Kaiser Window ( described below ) , a nonuniform quantizer , and a reworking of the bitstream format to handle up to 16 stereo channels , 16 mono channels , 16 low-frequency effect ( LFE ) channels and 16 commentary channels in one bitstream .
The Main profile adds a set of recursive predictors that are calculated on each tap of the filterbank .
The SSR uses a 4-band PQMF filterbank , with four shorter filterbanks following , in order to allow for scalable sampling rates .
In 1999 , MPEG-2 Part 7 was updated and included in the MPEG-4 family of standard and became known as MPEG-4 Part 3 , MPEG-4 Audio or ISO\/IEC 14496-3 :1999 .
This update included several improvements .
One of these improvements was the addition of Audio Object Types which are used to allow interoperability with a diverse range of other audio formats such as TwinVQ , CELP , HVXC , Text-To-Speech Interface and MPEG-4 Structured Audio .
Another notable addition in this version of the AAC standard is Perceptual Noise Substitution ( PNS ) .
In that regard , the AAC profiles ( AAC-LC , AAC Main and AAC-SSR profiles ) are combined with perceptual noise substitution and are defined in the MPEG-4 audio standard as Audio Object Types .
MPEG-4 Audio Object Types are combined in four MPEG-4 Audio profiles : Main ( which includes most of the MPEG-4 Audio Object Types ) , Scalable ( AAC LC , AAC LTP , CELP , HVXC , TwinVQ , Wavetable Synthesis , TTSI ) , Speech ( CELP , HVXC , TTSI ) and Low Rate Synthesis ( Wavetable Synthesis , TTSI ) .
The reference software for MPEG-4 Part 3 is specified in MPEG-4 Part 5 and the conformance bit-streams are specified in MPEG-4 Part 4 .
MPEG-4 Audio remains backward-compatible with MPEG-2 Part 7 .
The MPEG-4 Audio Version 2 ( ISO\/IEC 14496-3 :1999 \/ Amd 1:2000 ) defined new audio object types : the low delay AAC ( AAC-LD ) object type , bit-sliced arithmetic coding ( BSAC ) object type , parametric audio coding using harmonic and individual line plus noise and error resilient ( ER ) versions of object types .
It also defined four new audio profiles : High Quality Audio Profile , Low Delay Audio Profile , Natural Audio Profile and Mobile Audio Internetworking Profile .
The HE-AAC Profile ( AAC LC with SBR ) and AAC Profile ( AAC LC ) were first standardized in ISO\/IEC 14496-3 :2001 \/ Amd 1:2003 .
The HE-AAC v2 Profile ( AAC LC with SBR and Parametric Stereo ) was first specified in ISO\/IEC 14496-3 :2005 \/ Amd 2:2006 .
The Parametric Stereo audio object type used in HE-AAC v2 was first defined in ISO\/IEC 14496-3 :2001 \/ Amd 2:2004 .
The current version of the AAC standard is defined in ISO\/IEC 14496-3 :2009 .
AAC + v2 is also standardized by ETSI ( European Telecommunications Standards Institute ) as TS 102005 .
The MPEG-4 Part 3 standard also contains other ways of compressing sound .
These include lossless compression formats , synthetic audio and low bit-rate compression formats generally used for speech .
Advanced Audio Coding is designed to be the successor of the MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 , known as MP3 format , which was specified by ISO\/IEC in 11172-3 ( MPEG-1 Audio ) and 13818-3 ( MPEG-2 Audio ) .
Blind tests show that AAC demonstrates greater sound quality and transparency than MP3 for files coded at the same bit rate .
Improvements include : More sample frequencies ( from 8 to 96 kHz ) than MP3 ( 16 to 48 kHz ) Up to 48 channels ( MP3 supports up to two channels in MPEG-1 mode and up to 5.1 channels in MPEG-2 mode ) Arbitrary bit-rates and variable frame length .
Standardized constant bit rate with bit reservoir .
Higher efficiency and simpler filterbank ( rather than MP3 's hybrid coding , AAC uses a pure MDCT ) Higher coding efficiency for stationary signals ( AAC uses a blocksize of 1024 or 960 samples , allowing more efficient coding than MP3 's 576 sample blocks ) Higher coding accuracy for transient signals ( AAC uses a blocksize of 128 or 120 samples , allowing more accurate coding than MP3 's 192 sample blocks ) Can use Kaiser-Bessel derived window function to eliminate spectral leakage at the expense of widening the main lobe .
Much better handling of audio frequencies above 16 kHz .
More flexible joint stereo ( different methods can be used in different frequency ranges ) Adds additional modules ( tools ) to increase compression efficiency : TNS , Backwards Prediction , PNS etc. .
.
These modules can be combined to constitute different encoding profiles .
Overall , the AAC format allows developers more flexibility to design codecs than MP3 does , and corrects many of the design choices made in the original MPEG-1 audio specification .
This increased flexibility often leads to more concurrent encoding strategies and , as a result , to more efficient compression .
However , in terms of whether AAC is better than MP3 , the advantages of AAC are not entirely decisive , and the MP3 specification , although antiquated , has proven surprisingly robust in spite of considerable flaws .
AAC and HE-AAC are better than MP3 at low bit rates ( typically less than 128 kilobits per second ) .
This is especially true at very low bit rates where the superior stereo coding , pure MDCT , and better transform window sizes leave MP3 unable to compete .
While the MP3 format has near-universal hardware and software support , primarily due to MP3 being the format of choice during the crucial first few years of widespread music file-sharing\/distribution over the internet , AAC is a strong contender due to some unwavering industry support .
AAC takes a modular approach to encoding .
Depending on the complexity of the bitstream to be encoded , the desired performance and the acceptable output , implementers may create profiles to define which of a specific set of tools they want to use for a particular application .
The MPEG-2 Part 7 standard ( Advanced Audio Coding ) was first published in 1997 and offers three default profiles : Low Complexity ( LC ) - the simplest and most widely used and supported ; Main Profile ( Main ) - like the LC profile , with the addition of backwards prediction ; Scalable Sample Rate ( SSR ) ( MPEG-4 AAC-SSR ) - a.k.a. Sample-Rate Scalable ( SRS ) ; The MPEG-4 Part 3 standard ( MPEG-4 Audio ) defined various new compression tools ( a.k.a. Audio Object Types ) and their usage in brand new profiles .
AAC is not used in some of the MPEG-4 Audio profiles .
The MPEG-2 Part 7 AAC LC profile , AAC Main profile and AAC SSR profile are combined with Perceptual Noise Substitution and defined in the MPEG-4 Audio standard as Audio Object Types ( under the name AAC LC , AAC Main and AAC SSR ) .
These are combined with other Object Types in MPEG-4 Audio profiles .
Here is a list of some audio profiles defined in the MPEG-4 standard : Main Audio Profile - defined in 1999 , uses most of the MPEG-4 Audio Object Types ( AAC Main , AAC-LC , AAC-SSR , AAC-LTP , AAC Scalable , TwinVQ , CELP , HVXC , TTSI , Main synthesis ) Scalable Audio Profile - defined in 1999 , uses AAC-LC , AAC-LTP , AAC Scalable , TwinVQ , CELP , HVXC , TTSI .
Speech Audio Profile - defined in 1999 , uses CELP , HVXC , TTSI .
Synthetic Audio Profile - defined in 1999 , TTSI , Main synthesis .
High Quality Audio Profile - defined in 2000 , uses AAC-LC , AAC-LTP , AAC Scalable , CELP , ER-AAC-LC , ER-AAC-LTP , ER-AAC Scalable , ER-CELP .
Low Delay Audio Profile - defined in 2000 , uses CELP , HVXC , TTSI , ER-AAC-LD , ER-CELP , ER-HVXC .
Mobile Audio Internetworking Profile - defined in 2000 , uses ER-AAC-LC , ER-AAC-Scalable , ER-TwinVQ , ER-BSAC , ER-AAC-LD .
AAC Profile - defined in 2003 , uses AAC-LC .
High Efficiency AAC Profile - defined in 2003 , uses AAC-LC , SBR .
High Efficiency AAC v2 Profile - defined in 2006 , uses AAC-LC , SBR , PS .
( One of many improvements in MPEG-4 Audio is the Object Type - Long Term Prediction ( LTP ) , which is an improvement of the Main profile using a forward predictor with lower computational complexity . )
Depending on the AAC profile and the MP3 encoder , 96 kbit\/s AAC can give nearly the same or better perceptual quality as 128 kbit\/s MP3 .
Applying error protection enables error correction up to a certain extent .
Error correcting codes are usually applied equally to the whole payload .
However , since different parts of an AAC payload show different sensitivity to transmission errors , this would not be a very efficient approach .
The AAC payload can be subdivided into parts with different error sensitivities .
Independent error correcting codes can be applied to any of these parts using the Error Protection ( EP ) tool defined in MPEG-4 Audio standard .
This toolkit provides the error correcting capability to the most sensitive parts of the payload in order to keep the additional overhead low .
The toolkit is backwardly compatible with simpler and pre-existing AAC decoders .
A great deal of the tool kit 's error correction functions are based around spreading information about the audio signal more evenly in the datastream .
Error Resilience ( ER ) techniques can be used to make the coding scheme itself more robust against errors .
For AAC , three custom-tailored methods were developed and defined in MPEG-4 Audio .
Huffman Codeword Reordering ( HCR ) to avoid error propagation within spectral data ; Virtual Codebooks ( VCB11 ) to detect serious errors within spectral data ; Reversible Variable Length Code ( RVLC ) to reduce error propagation within scale factor data .
The MPEG-4 Low Delay Audio Coder ( AAC-LD ) is designed to combine the advantages of perceptual audio coding with the low delay necessary for two-way communication .
It is closely derived from the MPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding ( AAC ) format .
In December 2003 , Japan started broadcasting terrestrial DTV ISDB-T standard that implements MPEG-2 video and MPEG-2 AAC audio .
In April 2006 Japan started broadcasting the ISDB-T mobile sub-program , called 1seg , that was the first implementation of video H. 264\/AVC with audio HE-AAC in Terrestrial HDTV broadcasting service on the planet .
In December 2007 , Brazil started broadcasting terrestrial DTV standard called International ISDB-Tb that implements video coding H. 264\/AVC with audio AAC-LC on main program ( single or multi ) and video H. 264\/AVC with audio HE-AACv2 in the 1seg mobile sub-program .
The ETSI , the standards governing body for the DVB suite , supports AAC , HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 audio coding in DVB applications since at least 2004 .
DVB broadcasts which use the H. 264 compression for video normally use HE-AAC for audio .
In April 2003 , Apple brought mainstream attention to AAC by announcing that its iTunes and iPod products would support songs in MPEG-4 AAC format ( via a firmware update for older iPods ) .
Customers could download music in a closed-source Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) - restricted form of AAC ( see FairPlay ) via the iTunes Store or create files without DRM from their own CDs using iTunes .
In later years , Apple began offering music videos and movies , which also use AAC for audio encoding .
On May 29 , 2007 , Apple began selling songs and music videos free of DRM from participating record labels .
These files mostly adhere to the AAC standard and are playable on many non-Apple products but they do include custom iTunes information such as album artwork and a purchase receipt , so as to identify the customer in case the file is leaked out onto peer-to-peer networks .
It is possible , however , to remove these custom tags to restore interoperability with players that conform strictly to the AAC specification .
As of January 6 , 2009 , nearly all music on the iTunes Store became DRM-free , with the remainder becoming DRM-free by the end of March 2009 .
iTunes supports a `` Variable bit rate '' ( VBR ) encoding option which encodes AAC tracks in an `` Average bit rate '' ( ABR ) scheme .
As of September 2009 , Apple has added support for HE-AAC ( which is fully part of the MP4 standard ) only for radio streams , not file playback , and iTunes still lacks support for true VBR encoding .
The underlying QuickTime API does offer a true VBR encoding profile however .
For a number of years , many mobile phones from manufacturers such as Nokia , Motorola , Samsung , Sony Ericsson , BenQ-Siemens and Philips have supported AAC playback .
The first such phone was the Nokia 5510 released in 2002 which also plays MP3s .
However , this phone was a commercial failure and such phones with integrated music players did not gain mainstream popularity until 2005 when the trend of having AAC as well as MP3 support continued .
Most new smartphones and music-themed phones support playback of these formats .
Sony Ericsson phones support various AAC formats in MP4 container .
AAC-LC is supported in all phones beginning with K700 , phones beginning with W550 have support of HE-AAC .
The latest devices such as the P990 , K610 , W890i and later support HE-AAC v2 .
Nokia XpressMusic and other new generation Nokia multimedia phones like N - and E-Series : also support AAC format in LC , HE , M4A and HEv2 profiles .
BlackBerry : RIM 's latest series of Smartphones such as the 8100 ( `` Pearl '' ) , 9500 ( `` Storm '' ) and 8800 support AAC .
Apple 's iPhone supports AAC and FairPlay protected AAC files formerly used as the default encoding format in the iTunes store until the removal of DRM restrictions in March 2009 .
All recent Android phones support AAC-LC , HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 in MP4 or M4A containers along with several other audio formats .
From Android 3.1 also raw ADTS files are supported .
Android 4.0 can also encode these kind of files .
The HTC Dream ( Also known as the T-Mobile G1 ) is described as supporting certain subset of the full AAC format .
As of 2009-04-13 at least several forms of AAC files played while others did not play .
WebOS by HP\/Palm supports AAC , AAC + , eAAC + , and .
m4a containers in its native music player as well as several third-party players .
However , it does not support Apple 's FairPlay DRM files downloaded from iTunes .
Windows Phone 7 : WP7 's Silverlight runtime supports AAC-LC , HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 decoding .
A very common program supporting AAC playback is Flash Player , version 9 , update 3 and above .
Since Flash Player is also a browser plugin , it can play AAC files through a browser as well .
The Rockbox open source firmware ( available for multiple portable players ) also offers support for AAC to varying degrees , depending on the model of player and the AAC profile .
Optional iPod support ( playback of unprotected AAC files ) for the Xbox 360 is available as a free download from Xbox Live .
Almost all current computer media players include built-in decoders for AAC , or can utilize a library to decode it .
On Microsoft Windows , DirectShow can be used this way with the corresponding filters to enable AAC playback in any DirectShow based player .
Mac OS X supports AAC via the QuickTime libraries .

Plug-ins for Winamp and foobar2000 enable the creation of such streams .
In May 2006 , Nero AG released an AAC encoding tool free of charge , Nero Digital Audio ( Nero AAC Codec ) , which is capable of encoding LC-AAC , HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 streams .
The tool is a Command Line Interface tool only .
A separate utility is also included to decode to PCM WAV .
Various tools including the foobar2000 audio player , MediaCoder , MeGUI encoding front end and dBpoweramp can provide a GUI for this encoder .
