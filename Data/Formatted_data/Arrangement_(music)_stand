An arrangement of a musical composition is a reworking of a piece of music so that it can be played by a different instrument or combination of instruments from the original .
For example , a song written for one voice with piano accompaniment might be arranged so that it can be sung in parts by a choir , or a piece for violin might be arranged so that it can be played on a clarinet instead .
The person who does the arrangement may be the composer himself , or it may be someone else .
In music history , composers often published their compositions , saying that the music could be played or sung by various instruments .
For example , when English composers published madrigals in the late 16th century they often stated that they could be sung by singers or played on viols ( `` apt for voices as for viols '' ) .
In the Classical music period a composer might publish a sonata , stating that it could be played on the violin or flute or recorder .
This helped to sell more copies , because violinists , flautists and recorder players might all want to buy the music .
In a sense this is not really an arrangement , because no changes have been made to the music .
However , when violin or cello music is arranged so that it can be played on a viola , some changes may be necessary as the viola may be playing in a different key , or some chords may be more awkward the way they were originally written .
This in an arrangement .
A popular piece such as The Flight of the Bumble Bee by Rimsky-Korsakov can be played by almost any melodic instrument : violin , xylophone , tuba etc. .
These are all arrangements .
When a piece for choir and orchestra is printed for choir members to use , the orchestral part is printed on two staves so that it can be played on a piano for rehearsals .
This is another kind of arrangement .
In music history , many composers have made arrangements of music composed by others .
They did this in order to learn about musical composition , as well as in order to be able to play it on another instrument .
For example , Johann Sebastian Bach made arrangements of four concertos by Vivaldi so that they could be played on the organ .
Arrangements are often made by people who play instruments that have not had much music written for them .
People who play the viola , guitar , tuba etc often arrange other music so that they have a larger repertoire ( more music to play ) .
Sometimes composers have made changes to the orchestration of works for orchestra written by others .
They may have done this because instruments had changed since the music was written , or simply because they thought they could do it better .
For example , Mozart made an arrangement of Handels Messiah , adding instruments such as clarinets which Handel would not have known .
Rimsky-Korsakov made arrangements of the operas by Musorgsky thinking that he was improving them .
Arrangements are sometimes made because a player has some disability .
Cyril Smith , a pianist who only had one arm , played piano duets with his wife Phyllis Sellick .
They arranged piano duets so that they could be played by three hands .
Sometimes arrangements are made of well-known classical pieces in which the music is `` jazzed up '' or made to sound more popular for movie or theater performances .
Sometimes musicians think this is not a good thing .
Sometimes small vocal groups such as the Swingle Singers make lighthearted versions of works by Bach and others .
Musicians will never all agree about which is better : an arrangement or the original version .
Each piece of music should really be judged on its own .
