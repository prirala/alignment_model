Absolute_zero	It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at − 273.15 ° C , at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer .	Also , the particles can not move in `` reverse '' either because as the movement of particles is vibration , vibrating in reverse would be nothing but simply vibrating again .	0

Absolute_zero	It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at − 273.15 ° C , at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer .	The closer the temperature of an object gets to absolute zero , the less resistive the material is to electricity therefore it will conduct electricity almost perfectly , with no measurable resistance .	0
