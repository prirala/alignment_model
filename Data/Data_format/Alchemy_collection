Alchemists not only tried to create gold but they also looked for self-purification ( to separate the pure from the impure with great care ) and enlightenment .	0

Alchemy	These writings lack the mystical , philosophical elements of alchemy , but do contain the works of Bolus of Mendes ( or Pseudo-Democritus ) which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the Classical elements .	Alchemy is a study of the basic elements called fire , water , earth and air .	0
