Aegyptosaurus , meaning `` Egypt 's Lizard '' after the country where it was discovered ( comes from the Greek word sauros , which means ` lizard ' ) , is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in Africa around 95 million years ago , during the Late Cretaceous period .
Like most sauropods , it had a long neck and a small skull .
The animal 's long tail probably acted as a counterweight to its body mass .
Its tail also ended in a whip-like structure that it used to defend itself against predatory dinosaurs that lived in the same place and time as it , such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus .
Aegyptosaurus was a close relative of Argentinosaurus , a much larger dinosaur that lived in South America at about the same time .
This suggests a possible land bridge between Africa and South America during the Cretaceous period .
Aegyptosaurus was discovered and named by a German paleontologist named Ernst Stromer in 1932 .
Its fossils have been found in Egypt , Niger , and in several different locations in the Sahara Desert .
All known specimens were discovered before 1939 .
The fossils were stored together in Munich , but were obliterated when an Allied bombing raid destroyed the museum where they were kept in 1944 , during World War II .
The type species is Aegyptosaurus baharijensis , named after the Bahariya Formation in Egypt , where the first fossils were found .
Aegyptosaurus was much smaller and more common than its contemporary , Paralititan .
Predators probably hunted the smaller Aegyptosaurus more often than the huge Paralititan .
