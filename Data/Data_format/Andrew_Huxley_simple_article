Sir Andrew Fielding Huxley OM FRS ( 22 November 1917 - 30 May 2012 ) was an English physiologist and biophysicist .
Huxley was the youngest son of the writer and editor Leonard Huxley by his second wife Rosalind Bruce .
He was the half-brother of the writer Aldous Huxley and fellow biologist Julian Huxley , and grandson of the biologist T H. Huxley .
He studied Natural Sciences at Trinity College , Cambridge .
Huxley won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his experimental and mathematical work with Alan Hodgkin on the basis of nerve action potentials .
These are the electrical impulses that make nerve fibers work , and so the whole central nervous system .
Hodgkin and Huxley shared the prize that year with Sir John Eccles , who was cited for research on nerve synapses .
Hodgkin and Huxley 's findings led the pair to suggest the existence of ion channels , which were found only decades later .
Huxley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 17 March 1955 .
He was President of the Royal Society from 1980 to 1985 , and Master of Trinity from 1984-1990 .
