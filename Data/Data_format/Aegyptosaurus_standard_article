Aegyptosaurus ( \/ iːˌdʒɪptɵˈsɔrəs \/ ) meaning ` Egypt 's lizard ' , for the country in which it was discovered ( Greek sauros meaning ` lizard ' ) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur believed to have lived in what is now Africa , around 95 million years ago , during the mid - and late-Cretaceous Period ( Albian to Cenomanian stages ) .
Like most sauropods , it had a long neck and a small skull .
The animal 's long tail probably acted as a counterweight to its body mass .
Aegyptosaurus was a close relative of Argentinosaurus , a much larger dinosaur found in South America .
Aegyptosaurus was described by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1932 .
Its fossils have been found in Egypt , Niger and in several different locations in the Sahara Desert .
All known examples were discovered before 1939 .
The fossils were stored together in Munich , but were obliterated when an Allied bombing raid destroyed the museum where they were kept in 1944 , during World War II .
It is possible that Aegyptosaurus was common prey for large predatory dinosaurs , such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus .
