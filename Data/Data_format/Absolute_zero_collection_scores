Absolute_zero	By international agreement , absolute zero is defined as 0K on the Kelvin scale and as − 273.15 ° on the Celsius scale .	This is because the efficiency ( percent of energy the engine uses up that is actually used to do the engine 's job ) is 100 % × ( 1-Toutside\/Tinside ) , which only is 100 % if the outside temperature is absolute zero which it ca n't be .	0

Absolute_zero	It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at − 273.15 ° C , at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer .	The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is − 273.15 ° C or − 459.67 ° F. At this stage the pressure of the particles is zero .	0

Absolute_zero	It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at − 273.15 ° C , at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer .	Also , the particles can not move in `` reverse '' either because as the movement of particles is vibration , vibrating in reverse would be nothing but simply vibrating again .	0

Absolute_zero	It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at − 273.15 ° C , at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer .	The closer the temperature of an object gets to absolute zero , the less resistive the material is to electricity therefore it will conduct electricity almost perfectly , with no measurable resistance .	0

Absolute_zero	It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at − 273.15 ° C , at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer .	This is because the efficiency ( percent of energy the engine uses up that is actually used to do the engine 's job ) is 100 % × ( 1-Toutside\/Tinside ) , which only is 100 % if the outside temperature is absolute zero which it ca n't be .	0

Absolute_zero	It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at − 273.15 ° C , at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer .	So , an engine ca n't be 100 % efficient , but you can make its efficiency closer to 100 % by making the inside temperature hotter and\/or the outside temperature colder .	0
