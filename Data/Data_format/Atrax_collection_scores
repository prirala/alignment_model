Atrax	During an attack the funnel-web spider generally maintains a tight grip on its victim and bites repeatedly , making it an especially traumatic experience for humans who are bitten and increasing the risk of severe envenomation .	In English they are sometimes called Sydney Funnel Web spiders because they come from around that part of Australia .	0
