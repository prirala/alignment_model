Alphonse Mucha , ( 24 July 1860 - 14 July 1939 ) , was a Czech Art Nouveau painter and decorative artist , best known for his distinct style and his images of women .
He produced many paintings , illustrations , advertisements , and designs .
Mucha moved to Paris in 1887 , continued his studies , and worked at producing magazine and advertising illustrations .
Around Christmas 1894 , Mucha happened to drop into a print shop where there was a sudden and unexpected need for a new advertising poster for a play starring Sarah Bernhardt , the most famous actress in Paris .
Mucha volunteered to produce a lithographed poster within two weeks , and on 1 January 1895 , the advertisement for the play Gismonda by Victorien Sardou appeared on the streets of the city .
It was an overnight sensation and announced the new artistic style and its creator to the citizens of Paris .
Bernhardt was so satisfied with the success of this first poster that she entered into a 6 year contract with Mucha .
Mucha produced a flurry of paintings , posters , advertisements , and book illustrations , as well as designs for jewellery , carpets , wallpaper , and theater sets in what was initially called the Mucha Style but became known as Art Nouveau ( French for ` new art ' ) .
Mucha 's works frequently featured beautiful , strong young women in flowing vaguely Neoclassical looking robes , often surrounded by lush flowers which sometimes formed halos behind the women 's heads .
In contrast with contemporary poster makers he used pale pastel colors .
The 1900 Paris Exhibition spread the `` Mucha style '' abroad , of which Mucha said `` I think ( the Exposition Universelle ) made some contribution toward bringing aesthetic values into arts and crafts . ''
He decorated the Bosnia and Herzegovina Pavilion and collaborated in the Austrian Pavilion .
Mucha 's Art Nouveau style was often imitated .
The Art Nouveau style however , was one that Mucha attempted to distance himself from .
He always insisted that his paintings came purely from within and from Czech art .
He declared that art existed only to communicate a spiritual message , and nothing more .
He was frustrated at the fame he gained through commercial art , when he most wanted to concentrate on more lofty projects that would ennoble art and his birthplace .
