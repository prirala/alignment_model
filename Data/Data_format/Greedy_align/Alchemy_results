Alchemy	The era also saw a flourishing of con artists who would use chemical tricks and sleight of hand to `` demonstrate '' the transmutation of common metals into gold , or claim to possess secret knowledge that-with a `` small '' initial investment-would surely lead to that goal .	It was first studied to learn how to change lead into gold .	0

Alchemy	As the language of the alchemists is analyzed , historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history , such as the evolution of science and philosophy , the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities , kabbalism , spiritualism , Rosicrucianism , and other mystic movements .	Some things that the alchemists learned about were important for other sciences , like chemistry .	0

Alchemy	He claimed the material substances and procedures were only a projection of the alchemists ' internal state , while the real substance to be transformed was the mind itself .

Alchemy	The synthesis of noble metals enjoyed brief popularity in the 20th century when physicists were able to convert platinum atoms into gold atoms via a nuclear reaction .

Alchemy	However , the new gold atoms , being unstable isotopes , lasted for under five seconds before they broke apart .	But it cost much more to transform the energy to do this than the tiny amount of gold was worth .	0
