Absolute_zero	The zero point of any thermodynamic temperature scale , such as Kelvin or Rankine , is set at absolute zero .	The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins ( K ) or 0 degrees Rankine ( ° R ) .	3

Absolute_zero	The laws of thermodynamics state that absolute zero can not be reached using only thermodynamic means .	The Third Law of Thermodynamics says that nothing can ever have a temperature of absolute zero .	3

Absolute_zero	A system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero-point energy , the energy of its ground state .	Even getting close to absolute zero is difficult because anything that touches an object being cooled near absolute zero would give heat to the objects .	0

Absolute_zero	This equates to − 459.67 ° on the Fahrenheit scale and 0 R on the Rankine scale .	The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is − 273.15 ° C or − 459.67 ° F. At this stage the pressure of the particles is zero .	2

Absolute_zero	In his instrument , temperatures were indicated by the height at which a column of mercury was sustained by a certain mass of air , the volume , or `` spring '' , of which varied with the heat to which it was exposed .	The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that all engines that are powered by heat ( like car engines and steam train engines ) must release waste heat and ca n't be 100 % efficient .	0

Absolute_zero	Absolute zero is the theoretical temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value .	In theory , absolute zero is the temperature where the particles of matter stop moving .	3

Absolute_zero	It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at − 273.15 ° C , at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer .	The closer the temperature of an object gets to absolute zero , the less resistive the material is to electricity therefore it will conduct electricity almost perfectly , with no measurable resistance .	0

Absolute_zero	John Dalton in his Chemical Philosophy gave ten calculations of this value , and finally adopted − 3000 ° C as the natural zero of temperature .	This is because the efficiency ( percent of energy the engine uses up that is actually used to do the engine 's job ) is 100 % × ( 1-Toutside\/Tinside ) , which only is 100 % if the outside temperature is absolute zero which it ca n't be .	0

Absolute_zero	On the scale he used , the boiling-point of water was marked at +73 and the melting-point of ice at 51 , so that the zero of his scale was equivalent to about − 240 on the Celsius scale .	Scientists use lasers to slow atoms when cooling objects to very low temperatures .	0

Absolute_zero	Values of this order for the absolute zero were not , however , universally accepted about this period .	Absolute zero is impossible to achieve , because all particles move , even if it is just a small vibration .	0

Absolute_zero	One of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was Robert Boyle .	So , an engine ca n't be 100 % efficient , but you can make its efficiency closer to 100 % by making the inside temperature hotter and\/or the outside temperature colder .	0

Absolute_zero	Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth ( as one of the four so-called `` elements '' ) , others within water , others air , and some more recently within nitre .	The temperature can not go down any further .	0

Absolute_zero	Scientists have achieved temperatures very close to absolute zero , where matter exhibits quantum effects such as superconductivity and superfluidity .	Some people have created temperatures very close to absolute zero , but the record temperature was 100 pK ( Picokelvin ) above absolute zero .	1

Absolute_zero	Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air in it was reduced to nothing .	If we plot a graph to it , we can see that the temperature of the particles is zero .	0
	0.505275326480876
Absolute_zero	The kinetic energy of the ground state can not be removed .	Also , the particles can not move in `` reverse '' either because as the movement of particles is vibration , vibrating in reverse would be nothing but simply vibrating again .	0
